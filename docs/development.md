# Development

Read [Architecture](architecture/overview.md) before changing authority, lifecycle, App Server integration, or service management.

## Pinned protocol contract

The Codex CLI/App Server release is pinned in `config/codex-cli-pin`. `scripts/generate-app-server-tool-schemas.py` verifies the installed release, generates its experimental schema, and checks the protocol subset used by the adapter.

`config/app-server-tool-schemas.json` is an internal protocol drift guard, not the public MCP catalog. App Server owns official thread, turn, review, command, filesystem, approval, permission, elicitation, account, and notification semantics. Connect may project or adapt them, and may add a bridge only where the pinned App Server has no equivalent (currently content search and deterministic patch semantics).

## Public MCP governance

The public catalog and schemas are owned by `crates/mcp/src/catalog.rs`; parsing and dispatch are in `crates/mcp/src/lib.rs`. Update both with protocol tests when changing inputs or outputs.

Expose choices that control operator intent. Keep execution limits and the worker wait budget in the relay; MCP guards must allow operations to finalize. `codex.wait` accepts only thread and turn IDs. `command.read.timeoutMs` supports immediate reads and bounded waits for interactive processes.

Keep service tier, raw sandbox/approval policy, developer instructions, and cache controls internal. Preserve tool annotations, OAuth metadata, compact schemas, and PTY support. Test accepted inputs, outputs, and behavior without locking explanatory prose.

## Worker contract

Worker instructions come from Codex config, AGENTS.md, and the delegated task. Connect supplies authority and lifecycle controls; it does not inject developer instructions.

Work uses `approvalPolicy="never"` with the selected workspace or full-access sandbox. Disabling prompts does not widen the sandbox. New reviews start read-only.

Preserve the [worker lifecycle and recovery contract](operations.md#worker-lifecycle). Starts complete independently of caller lifetime. Events drive live state; reads hydrate existing state, reconcile history loss or wait expiry, and load terminal output. Do not poll App Server for progress.

Each tool descriptor advertises OAuth scope `codex-connect:access`. Host ingress owns token validation, discovery challenges, and authorization metadata.

## Validation

Run the repository gate with the pinned CLI installed and Python `jsonschema` available:

```bash
./scripts/generate-app-server-tool-schemas.py --check
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo check --locked
cargo build --locked -p codex-connect
python3 tests/protocol_integration.py
```

The protocol tests validate the exact catalog, App Server request/response schemas, server requests, streaming commands, worker authority mapping, and end-to-end lifecycle. Do not weaken a test or schema to accommodate an unpinned CLI.

For documentation changes, verify local Markdown links and search for stale contract references. Validation does not include commit, push, deployment, or connector refresh.

## Dependency and change discipline

Keep durable product behavior separate from diagnostics and scratch tooling. Prefer existing abstractions and standard library code for small changes. Review dependency and compile impact. When semantics change, rename the concept across code, schemas, tests, docs, comments, and examples; do not retain aliases, fallback readers, migration shims, deprecated names, or dual paths without an explicit current requirement.
